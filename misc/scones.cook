>> name: Scones

Preheat #oven to 200Â°C. Sift @self-raising flour{3%cups} into a #large bowl{}.

Using your fingertips, rub @butter{80%grams} into flour until mixture resembles breadcrumbs.

Make a well in the centre. Add @milk{1%cup}. Mix with a flat-bladed knife until mixture forms a soft dough, adding more milk if required. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently until smooth (don't knead dough too much or scones will be tough).

Lightly dust a flat #baking tray{} with @plain flour{}.

Pat dough into a 2cm-thick round. Using a 5cm (diameter) round cutter, cut out 12 rounds. Press dough together and cut out remaining 4 rounds. Place scones onto prepared baking tray, 1cm apart. Sprinkle tops with a little plain flour.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and well risen. Transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm with jam and cream.
